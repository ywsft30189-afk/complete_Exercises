# Exercise 01: Coding is Cool

This repository contains my solution for the first exercise.

## Python Code:
```python
# Define the first word
word1 = "coding"

# Define the second word
word2 = "is"

# Define the third word
word3 = "cool"

# Combine the words with spaces and print the result
print(word1, word2, word3)
